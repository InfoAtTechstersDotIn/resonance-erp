Resonance College is one of the pioneered colleges established on 11th April 2021. Besides the bricks and cement, there was a lot of hardwork and determination of an entrepreneur behind the foundation of this college. He is Mr. R.K Verma, a B.tech Electrical and Electronics graduate from IIT Madras. His journey has started coming from a remote place to becoming an educationalist fulfilling the dreams of many students who aspire to become an engineer or a doctor by providing the best coaching for the JEE Mains and NEET Preparation.

We are one of the earliest institutions to launch the Distance Learning Program Division in 2005 for the students who are having concerns about leaving their native places. In the next year, i.e., in 2006, we launched Pre-Foundation Career Care (PCCP) Programs Division. It has also initiated Medical to Commerce & Law in the form of New Division Resonance Commerce & Law Program Division (CLPD). Gradually the Resonance has diversified, offering multiple portfolios of courses giving major importance to AIEEE/JEE (MAIN) & NEET(AIPMT). Our journey has not ended by hereon, and we believe there are many milestones to cross by giving the best quality coaching to the doctors and engineers of the future.
