Admission Fee Refund & Cancellation Policy

Once payment is made through the gateway & the transaction is successful, no refunds or cancellations will be permitted. However, in a few genuine cases, the Admission Fee Refund & Cancellation Policy applies to the payers.

•	The application fee, once paid, will not be refunded under any circumstances.
•	However, the college, considering the humanitarian grounds, will allow the fee refund in fewer cases. 
•	The applicants should visit the college physically offline and apply for the fee refund and cancellation.
•	The concerned applicant or the applicant's parent should fix an appointment with the institution's Chief Finance Officer (CFO).
•	The applicants can put forth their concerns before the CFO and apply the fee refund policy.
•	The CFO of our institution will consider the requests of the concerned applicants and approve the fee refund.
•	However, the entire process will take around a week to ten days till the refund is accepted.
•	The applicants should be with patience till their fee refund and cancellation applications are accepted.
